//! # vCPU throttling for Auto Converging
//!
//! vCPU throttling is crucial to reach a reasonable downtime when using a
//! precopy strategy for live-migration of VMs with memory-intensive workloads.
//! Auto converge means an increasing vCPU throttling over time until the memory
//! delta is small enough for the migration thread(s) to perform the switch-over
//! to the new host.
//!
//! Therefore, the migration thread(s) use this thread to help them reach their
//! goal. Next to typical lifecycle management, this thread must fulfill various
//! requirements to ensure a minimal downtime.
//!
//! ## Thread Requirements
//! - Needs to be able to gracefully wait for work.
//! - Must be able to exit gracefully.
//! - Must be able to cancel any work and return to its init state to support
//!   live-migration cancellation and restart of live-migrations.
//! - Must not block the migration thread(s) whenever possible, to facilitate
//!   fast live-migrations with short downtimes.
//! - Must be interruptible during a sleep phase to not block the migration
//!   thread(s).
//! - Must not confuse or hinder the migration thread(s) regarding
//!   pause()/resume() operations. Context: migration thread shuts down the
//!   vCPUs for the handover. The throttle thread must not restart the vCPUs
//!   again.
